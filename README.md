# cardShuffleAlgorithm-

This javascript randomly shuffles a deck of cards of arbitary size, from n = 3 to some large value.

Balances two constraints. (1) Sort array size (larger means fewer collisions) and (2) collision correction (which has some computational cost).

You could test empirically to find sweet spot for sort array size.
